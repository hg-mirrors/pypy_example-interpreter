Kermit - an example interpreter
-------------------------------

This is an example interpreter written using PyPy. A preferred way to walk
through it is to follow the history of commits. Interesting tags

parser-boilerplate - just cruft to make parser run
first-parse-test - enough support to make the first test of parser pass
parser-complete - implement enough of parser to run simple ifs and whiles
